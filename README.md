# **Python Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**  

This repository is being developed as a comprehensive guide to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python**. It will cover essential topics, providing explanations, Pythonic implementations, and problem-solving approaches.  

## **What This Repository Will Cover**  

### **Data Structures**  
- Lists – Dynamic arrays, slicing, list comprehensions  
- Tuples – Immutable sequences, packing/unpacking  
- Sets – Unordered unique elements, set operations  
- Dictionaries – Hash maps, dictionary comprehensions  

**Advanced Data Structures**  
- Stacks, Queues (deque, queue module)  
- Linked Lists – Singly and Doubly Linked Lists  
- Hash Tables – Collision handling  
- Heap (Priority Queue) – MinHeap, MaxHeap  
- Graphs – BFS, DFS, Adjacency List/Matrix  
- Trees – Binary Trees, BST, Trie, Segment Trees  

### **Algorithms**  
- Sorting – Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort  
- Searching – Binary Search, Interpolation Search  
- Recursion and Backtracking – N-Queens, Sudoku Solver  
- Dynamic Programming – Knapsack, LCS, LIS  
- Graph Algorithms – Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, MST  
- Tree Algorithms – LCA, Traversals, Segment Tree

✅ Dictionaries – Hash maps, dictionary comprehensions

🔹 Advanced Data Structures
✅ Stacks, Queues (deque, queue module)
✅ Linked Lists – Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
✅ Hash Tables – Collision handling
✅ Heap (Priority Queue) – MinHeap, MaxHeap
✅ Graphs – BFS, DFS, Adjacency List/Matrix
✅ Trees – Binary Trees, BST, Trie, Segment Trees

🔹 Algorithms
